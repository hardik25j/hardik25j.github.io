# Functional Component in React JS

## Welcome to JS Addiction

  I recently started learning about the [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html). I asked you, "What is benefits of functional components?".First Let's discuss about How to declare functional components and then their benefits over the class component.  
  
### Declaration

```markdown

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hardik25j/hardik25j.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
